2. Set your API keys and trading parameters.
3. Save the changes.

### Running the Bot

To start the bot, execute the following command in your terminal:

```

### Monitoring Performance

The bot will log its activities in the `logs` folder. Check these logs to monitor performance and make adjustments as needed.

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Arbitrage Trading

Arbitrage trading takes advantage of price differences across different exchanges. The bot will automatically buy low on one exchange and sell high on another.

### 2. Trend Following

This strategy involves following the market trend. The bot will buy when the market is bullish and sell when it is bearish.

### 3. Market Making

Market making involves placing buy and sell orders to profit from the spread. The bot will continuously update its orders based on market conditions.

### 4. Mean Reversion

This strategy assumes that prices will revert to their mean. The bot will buy when prices are low and sell when they are high.
